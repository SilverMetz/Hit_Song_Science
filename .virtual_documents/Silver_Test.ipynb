#Added the dataset, made variable with dataset, now I can make some graphs with it.


#Unfortunately, no artist names are given. So we cannot check if specific artists have been overrepresented in the set (so it doesn't contain 6000 Bach songs)


#Now I'm going to check the distribution of the feature values.

#Now let's try to make a histogram of all the features, first not grouped by the popularity, afterwards grouped by popularity. (oops. song_popularity is a range)
